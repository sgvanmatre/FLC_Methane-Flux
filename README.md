# Open-source Methane Flux Instrument

Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, has significantly increased in the Earth’s atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. A considerable portion of methane emissions stems from ground-to-atmosphere methane flux, originating from sources such as landfills, geologic seeps, and agricultural activities. These emissions exhibit spatial complexity and temporal variability, posing challenges in accurate characterization and mitigation.

Quantifying methane flux from these diverse sources is hindered by the lack of affordable measurement tools suitable for widespread deployment. There is a critical need for an instrument capable of measuring flux rates spanning 0.1 to 1000 g CH4 m-2 d-1 at landfills. The ideal instrument must operate autonomously with a remote power supply, and be compact and lightweight enough for easy transport by two individuals. It should provide flux measurements at hourly intervals and support cellular data transmission.

Through a collaborative effort between Fort Lewis College and CU Boulder's air quality laboratories, a low-cost, dynamic flux chamber was developed, calibrated, and validated for measuring methane flux within the range of 0-150 g/m²-day. The flux chamber utilizes a centrifugal PC blower fan and a flow meter in series to draw methane through a sensor chamber. Methane concentrations in the sensor chamber are monitored using four low-cost metal oxide sensors: a BME 680, along with Figaro TGS sensors (2600, 2602, and 2611). These sensors, leveraging overlapping sensitivity to methane concentration changes, were calibrated using a multiple linear regression approach based on extensive laboratory data.
